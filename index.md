## About myself

Hi there! I'm a Computer Engineer, I've been working as an Associate Professor at the [University of Zaragoza](http://www.unizar.es) (Spain) since April 2021. Previously, I've been working as an assistant professor at the same university (since Sept 2019) and at the [Centro Universitario de la Defensa-Zaragoza](http://cud.unizar.es/) (from Feb 2017 to Sept 2019), as a Senior Researcher at the [Research Institute of Applied Sciences in Cybersecurity](https://riasc.unileon.es/), [University of León](https://www.unileon.es/) (Spain) [from Jul 2014 to Sept 2015], and as a Junior Researcher at the [BABEL Research Group](https://babel.upm.es/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.fi.upm.es/), [Technical University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/) (Spain) [from Mar 2013 to Jun 2014]. 

I successfully defended my doctorate, entitled ["Performance Analysis and Resource Optimisation of Critical Systems Modelled by Petri Nets"](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/files/papers/RJRodriguez-PhD-Thesis.pdf), on June 24, 2013, at the [University of Zaragoza](http://www.unizar.es). My main research interest is the binary analysis of programs, especially applied in memory forensics and malware analysis. I also do research on formal models for performing survivability and performance analysis on complex systems. 

I am part of the [Distributed Computing research group](http://webdiis.unizar.es/DISCO/) at the University of Zaragoza and I am a member of the [Aragon Institute of Engineering Research](https://i3a.unizar.es/en). In particular, I'm the Principal Investigator in the research line focused on application of formal models to cybersecurity. Under this research line, we have created a webpage dedicated to disseminating our contributions. For more information, see [this link](https://reversea.me/).
