## About myself

Hi there! This webpage is just a summary of my CV focused on my research and teaching work. More detailed information (such as contact data) can be found on [my profile webpage of the University of Zaragoza](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/).

I'm a Computer Engineer, working as an assistant professor at [University of Zaragoza](http://www.unizar.es) (Spain) since September 2019. Formerly, I've been working as Senior Researcher at the [Research Instute of Applied Sciences in Cybersecurity](https://riasc.unileon.es/), [University of Le√≥n](https://www.unileon.es/) (Spain) and as Junior Researcher at the [BABEL Research Group](https://babel.upm.es/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.fi.upm.es/), [Technical University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/) (Spain). 

My main research interest is program binary analysis, specially applied in memory forensics and malware. I also  research on formal models to perform survivability and performance analysis in complex systems. 

I am part of the [Distributed Computing research group](http://webdiis.unizar.es/DISCO/) of the University of Zaragoza. In particular, I'm the Principal Investigator in the research line focused on application of formal models to cybersecurity. Under this research line, we have created a dedicated webpage to disseminate our contributions. For more information, see [this link](https://reversea.me/).
